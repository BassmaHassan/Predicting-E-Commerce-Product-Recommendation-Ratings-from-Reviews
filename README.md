# Predicting-E-Commerce-Product-Recommendation-Ratings-from-Reviews
Predicting E-Commerce Product Recommendation Ratings from Reviews using NLP.
This is a classic NLP problem dealing with data from an e-commerce store focusing on women's clothing. Each record in the dataset is a customer review which consists of the review title, text description and a rating (ranging from 1 - 5) for a product amongst other features

I convert this into a binary classification problem such that a customer recommends a product (label 1) is the rating is > 3 else they do not recommend the product (label 0)

Main Objective: Leverage the review text attributes to predict the recommendation rating (classification)
